# AssemblySteganography

Implementation of an audio based steganography program using MIPS assembly language.

Basic implementation of a steganograpgy program that 'hides' a message within the binary of an audio recording.

As is, the program severely limits the length of the key and audio file. 

This can be removed and used for larger key sizes with full length songs.

MARS simulator used for development.
